# DOM Manipulation Error Fixes

## Problem
The application was experiencing a `NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node'` error, which typically occurs when React tries to remove DOM nodes that have already been removed or don't exist in the expected location.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Animation Cleanup Issues**: Multiple animations running simultaneously without proper cleanup
2. **Conditional Rendering**: FlatList being conditionally mounted/unmounted during data updates
3. **React Query Re-renders**: Data refetching causing component re-renders during animations
4. **Missing Error Boundaries**: No protection against rendering errors

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Animation Cleanup (`HomeScreen.tsx`)
- **Auto-slide Animation**: Added proper cleanup with `stopAnimation()` calls
- **Modal Animations**: Added animation stopping before starting new animations
- **Component Unmount**: Added cleanup effect to stop all animations on unmount
- **Animation References**: Properly track and stop animation references

### 2. FlatList Stabilization
- **Removed Conditional Rendering**: FlatList now always renders with empty array fallback
- **Stable Key Extraction**: Added fallback keys for items
- **Performance Props**: Added `removeClippedSubviews={false}` and other performance props
- **Empty State Handling**: Used `ListEmptyComponent` instead of conditional rendering

### 3. ParallaxHero Component (`ParallaxHero.tsx`)
- **Error Handling**: Wrapped animation cleanup in try-catch blocks
- **Safe Cleanup**: Prevent errors during component unmount

### 4. Error Boundaries (`ErrorBoundary.tsx`)
- **Created Error Boundary Component**: Catches and handles rendering errors gracefully
- **Wrapped Critical Components**: Added error boundaries around ParallaxHero and main content
- **User-Friendly Fallback**: Shows retry option when errors occur

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- **React.memo**: Wrapped HomeScreen component to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Stable References**: Ensured animation values are stable across renders

## Key Changes Made

### HomeScreen.tsx
```typescript
// Before: Conditional FlatList rendering
{productsData.data && productsData.data.length > 0 ? (
  <FlatList data={productsData.data} ... />
) : (
  <Text>No products available</Text>
)}

// After: Stable FlatList with empty state handling
<FlatList
  data={productsData.data || []}
  ListEmptyComponent={() => <Text>No products available</Text>}
  removeClippedSubviews={false}
  ...
/>
```

### Animation Cleanup
```typescript
// Added cleanup effect
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    fadeAnim.stopAnimation();
    scaleAnim.stopAnimation();
    modalAnim.stopAnimation();
    modalScaleAnim.stopAnimation();
    scrollY.stopAnimation();
  };
}, []);
```

### Error Boundaries
```typescript
// Wrapped components with error boundaries
<ErrorBoundary>
  <ParallaxHero scrollY={scrollY}>
    {/* content */}
  </ParallaxHero>
</ErrorBoundary>
```

## Expected Results
- ✅ No more `removeChild` DOM manipulation errors
- ✅ Smoother animations without conflicts
- ✅ Better error handling and user experience
- ✅ Improved performance with fewer unnecessary re-renders
- ✅ More stable FlatList rendering

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test rapid navigation between screens
2. Test data refetching while animations are running
3. Test modal opening/closing rapidly
4. Test with slow network conditions
5. Test component unmounting during animations

## Additional Notes
- All changes maintain existing functionality
- Error boundaries provide graceful degradation
- Performance optimizations reduce unnecessary renders
- Animation cleanup prevents memory leaks
